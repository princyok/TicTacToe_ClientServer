# TicTacToe_ClientServer_Java

There are two applications here, hence the two .jar files. One runs a server that hosts the game, the server side. The other runs a GUI for a user to play with, the client side. The structure is a client-server architecture.
A tictactoe match must involve two opponents, i.e. two GUIs, 
for X and O players, and both are connected to single server-side game.
The server can host up to 5 separate tictactoe games, for a total of 10 players.
